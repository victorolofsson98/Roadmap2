# Functions

``Public: everyone has access to functions``\
``Private: only accessible from the class in which it is declared``\
``Protected: accessible from the package or subclasses in a different package``\
``Default: visible from the same package only, java uses the Default when no access specifier is declared.``

instance: In class-based, object-oriented programming, an instance variable is a variable defined in a class 
(i.e., a member variable), for which each instantiated object of the class has a separate copy, 
or instance. An instance variable has similarities with a class variable, but is non-static.
Variables declared inside a class but outside the scope of any blocks, constructors, 
or methods are known as instance variables in Java. (i.e., the fields).

static: doesn't need to create an instance to use the static function.
this: represents the instance that we're using.
