https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/packages-in-java/

Packages in Java is a mechanism to encapsulate a group
of classes, sub packages and interfaces.
Packages are used for preventing naming conflicts,
making searching and locating and uses of classes easier.
Providing controlled access, such as private and default.
Packages can be considered as data encapsulations or data-hiding.
All we need to do is put related classes into packages.

* built-in packages and user defined packages.

import the Vector class from util package.
import java.util.vector;

import all the classes from util package import
java.util.*; 

only mentioned class of this package will be accessible.
